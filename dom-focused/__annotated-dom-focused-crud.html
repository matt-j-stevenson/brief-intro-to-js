<!-- DOM Focused CRUD Application in Vanilla JS -->

<!-- To use this file simply drag it into Google Chrome! -->

<!-- This document describes how to build a totally "Vanilla" JavaScript
     CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) "app" without the need for any
     third-party libraries, frameworks or extensions - just plain old
     JavaScript (ES6) loaded with some HTML in the browser.
     No styling involved.

     Don't forget, this is a very specific approach to building a simple CRUD app,
     it is 'DOM-focused'. This means that we are utilising the Document Object Model
     to obtain references to our elements and manipulate them individually - be that
     creating, editing or deleting them from Local Storage.
     Note, there are several other and debatabley better ways to do this, for example -
     A data driven approach which re-renders the content entirely upon changes being applied
     to the data (just something to note!)

     There is also front-end JavaScript frameworks that are widely used and ensure that this process
     of writing JavaScript code to build front-end UI's is far less cumbersome whilst enabling some pretty
     nifty features that you'll definitely want to get to know soon for use with 'React' a framework designed
     and maintained by Facebook (Note, there is also 'Angular' by Google and Vue). With React being the most widely used
     and debated to be the 'best' for front-end development.

     * To view Local Storage updates on Google Chrome, right click, select 'Inspect Element'
     ('Inspect' on MacOS), select 'Application' and under 'Storage' you will see 'Local Storage',
     click here and you will see the DOM updates taking place in real-time within the browser. *

<title>DOM Focused CRUD App (Annotated)</title>
<!-- Create form HTML element, assign id field 'formBody' -->
<form id="formBody">
  <!-- Create input HTML element, assign id field 'textField', specify type of text, disable
       autocomplete -->
  <input id="textField" type="text" autocomplete="off" />
  <!-- Create button HTML element, there is no id property needed here as we later target this
       button in the JavaScript by using an event listener for 'submit' on the form element -->
  <button>Create Item</button>
</form>
<!-- Create an empty, unordered list HTML element, assign id field 'itemList' -->
<ul id="itemList"></ul>
<!-- CLOSE HTML -->

<!-- JAVASCRIPT -->
<!-- Script tags are required in an HTML document in order to use JavaScript -->
<script>
  // Create constant 'variables' for each element and obtain id's via the document
  // query selector. Note, there are a few different ways we can target and obtain
  // id's or class names of the document in JavaScript; here, we use the 'querySelector',
  // but we could also viably use 'getElementById'. Do you know which is best for this
  // scenario? Read more here: https://beamtic.com/getelementbyid-vs-queryselector
  // We use constants here as we know that these 'variables' won't change, they're
  // simply selectors for our elements.
  const form = document.querySelector("#formBody")
  const field = document.querySelector("#textField")
  const list = document.querySelector("#itemList")
  // Create a new, blank data array as a variable. Note, here we declare this as 'let',
  // not 'var'. 'Let' variables are much more widely used in modern, contemporary JavaScript as
  // they have their scope within the 'block' they are defined, whereas variables declared as 'var'
  // are 'function scoped' - meaning they are available throughout the wider program.
  // Let variables are also known as 'local variables'.
  // Read more here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/whats-the-difference-between-using-let-and-var
  let data = []
  // Check if the item 'DOM-data' exists in Local Storage...
  // Apply an event listener to the form constant containing the query selector (id) of our form HTML element.
  // Pass the keyword submit as a string parameter along with 'e' (Standing for 'event') in an ES6 arrow function.
  // Read more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
  form.addEventListener("submit", e => {
    // Using 'preventDefault' on the event here disables the default action from being carried out, here, that would
    // mean the submit action is not executed as it would if this function weren't called on our 'event'.
    // Read more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault
    e.preventDefault()
    // Insert the text as HTML into the list via '.insertAdjacentHTML', here, we need to specify where we want the HTML
    // to be loaded, we then pass the value of the input field to the template. Here, we use "beforeend", this means
    // the HTML will be inserted before the end of each item in the list.
    list.insertAdjacentHTML("beforeend", template(field.value))
    // Reset the input field value to a blank string, could we use 'field.value = null' here? What is best for this use-case?
    // Read more here: https://tinyurl.com/y548dltw
    field.value = ""
    // Call the saveData function and execute it's contents.
    saveData()
  })
  // Create a simple template function and pass 'item' as a parameter to be used later...
  function template(item) {
    // Here, just like any function in JavaScript we can return a series of HTML that looks a bit odd, that's because it has one difference.
    // We are using 'backticks' to enclose this HTML code, the reason for this is that we will later need to use our quotation
    // marks for specifying id's, classes or even function calls like we see on the buttons 'onclick' property.
    // Something to note here is that within our 'backticked' HTML we can use something called a 'template literal'. A template
    // literal allows expressions to be embedded into our HTML and is used here for 'string interpolation', where the value 'item'
    // being passed in is prefixed with a dollar sign and enclosed in curly braces, prompting to the browser that we want the string
    // to be rendered here as the 'item' parameter we passed into the function.
