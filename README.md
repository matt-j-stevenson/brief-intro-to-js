# MRP - A Brief Introduction to JavaScript
## Creating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications in Vanilla JavaScript

#### - DOM-focused Vanilla JavaScript approach, utilising the DOM to perform CRUD operations and update local storage appropriately for re-rendering updated elements within the DOM.
#### - Data-driven, using one render function, listening to changes, updating individual elements, re-rendering the entire templating (rather than just one element)

### It should be known before inspecting the code to each simple CRUD application that each of these methods of writing JavaScript code to perform actions, update DOM elements or build a sustainable, scalable and maleable User Interfaces are neither deemed to be the best ways in which to do so, by any means.

### These examples simply demonstrate two alternate ways in which the same simple, CRUD application can be written with a short HTML block and some corresponding JavaScript functions in an attempt to unlock deeper levels of knowledge about the inner-workings and what's going on "under the hood" before jumping into a front-end framework like React or Vue.

## Getting Started w/ "MRP - A Brief Introduction to JavaScript"
### You don't need anything other than a text-editor (IDE, pref. VSCode) to view code, a browser (pref. Google Chrome), and that's it!
### 1. Drag and drop the CRUD .html files into Google Chrome.
### 1(alt.) Open VSCode, select 'Extensions', install 'Live Server' by Ritwick Dey. Navigate to bottom right of VSCode window, select 'Go Live' button (this will open a local html-server window on Chrome).
### 2. Right-click on the web browser window were the app is loaded, click 'Inspect' ('Inspect Element' on Windows).
### Open the 'Console' to see what actions are taking place in the app when you add new items, edit them or delete them.
### Navigate to 'Application' in Inspect side-panel, select 'Local Storage'. From here you can see what data is being saved into local storage (strings).
### Click on the 'Value' header to view the data format.

#### The .htmls files in each folder contain the exact same 'application', each portion of code generates the exact same output. One difference is that they are designed differently, not the look and feel - but the code structure and the approach to which the actions we need to perform are performed.
